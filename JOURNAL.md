# Hello Journal
For this project the idea is to make a product visualizer about bottles.
The main idea is that the visualizer could help an imaginary wine producer, or general beverage producer, to select the right
type of bottle that will contain his product.

For this project I would like to use ReactJS in combination with THREEJS to control the state of the configurator and the many different typologies of materials and objects that the configurator could present to the customer.
